            <div class="work" style="height: 400px; overflow-y: scroll;">
                <p>
                    Born August 1, 1998 | Born in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture
                    <br>
                    I've always loved drawing.
                    <br>
                    I also love moving my body, and before I knew it, I was drawing in my notebook or sketchbook during
                    class.
                    I was born with a congenital disability called ASD, and since I was a child, I have had the tendency
                    to not listen to instructions about things I don't understand.
                    <br>
                    I may still be like that.
                    <br>
                    But on the other hand, I'm very sensitive to things that come from within me.
                    <br>
                    I don't know much about the history of art or the names of famous painters. I rarely imitate or make
                    drafts.
                    But if my heart moves me in this moment, my hand moves.
                    <br>
                    Draw freely. Don't draw with a sense of mission.
                    <br>
                    Don't be bound by evaluations or rules, just give shape to what comes out of you---
                    <br>
                    That's what "drawing" means to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I won an award for a drawing was when I was in the second grade of elementary school.
                    It was a drawing I did for a school event of "a picture of a mysterious character living on a big
                    tree." To be honest, I remember submitting it without really being satisfied with it (laughs).
                    <br>
                    When I entered high school and joined the art club, I was very surprised when my teacher told me for
                    the first time that "you can use as many art materials as you like." From then on, I started to
                    paint abstract paintings in earnest.
                    In my first and third years, I exhibited a work called "Untitled" right before the deadline.
                    <br>
                    I didn't attach any particular meaning to the title, I just thought that "a work is a work."
                    That work won the Excellence Award. Everyone around me was surprised, but to be honest, I was the
                    most surprised of all. Although I was confused that my work was not satisfactory, it was my first
                    experience of "my expression reaching someone".
                    <br>
                    I am strongly attracted to the "energy" of nature, animals, and living things.
                    I also believe that art has the power to give energy and influence people.
                    <br>
                    Perhaps looking at art can soften the heart, stimulate the brain, and help people become aware of
                    mild dementia.
                    <br>
                    It may change the way you perceive things.
                    <br>
                    Art is a form of learning. That's what I think.
                    <br>
                    I hope to be able to ease someone's mind and thoughts through my expression, and to convey a new
                    perspective to them.
                    <br>
                    Sensation over knowledge.
                    <br>
                    Emotional movement over technique.
                    <br>
                    Energy over meaning.
                    <br>
                    I would like to continue expressing myself in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating from high school, I went on to a vocational school for design.
                    <br>
                    The reason why I chose design was simply because I wanted to try making abstract paintings
                    digitally, but I wasn't really interested in design itself.
                    <br>
                    As I studied, I began to feel that the field of design wasn't for me.
                    The reason was that I had the impression that design was about bringing out people's desires and
                    expressing things in an exaggerated way.
                    <br>
                    I had a strong desire to purify people's hearts and heal them.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, at the time, design seemed to me like something that brought out the ugliness in people,
                    and I naturally distanced myself from it.
                    <br>
                    After that, I lost track of what I really wanted to do, and I worked in a variety of jobs as a
                    part-timer for about four years.
                    "Sorting logistics, picking, call centers, moving and relocation work, demolition, clerical work,
                    nursing care assistance, leather craft, cleaning, event staff (setup and removal), exterior wall
                    installation, agriculture, etc."
                    <br>
                    Many of the jobs were short-term, but they were all valuable learning opportunities for me.
                    <br>
                    The most memorable job was sorting at a logistics warehouse.
                    <br>
                    I was in the same space with the same people for a long time, 10 to 12 hours a day. At first, I
                    suffered from the extremely heavy atmosphere.
                    It was an atmosphere where even saying a word was tiring, and many people just talked and did
                    nothing, so at first I was just angry.
                    However, at one point I felt that "I will break if I continue like this," so I started making an
                    effort to change the environment little by little.
                    I changed my mindset and reconsidered how I interacted with others.
                    <br>
                    Within a year, there were more smiles and laughter in the workplace, jokes and casual conversations
                    were born, and the atmosphere among everyone gradually became more relaxed.
                    I think that time helped me to develop the ability to see the world around me objectively and to be
                    more flexible myself.
                    <br>
                    I am still grateful to the people who led me to that place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when I left that workplace, I started my art activities.
                    <br>
                    I remembered that I had only ever exhibited at school events, so I applied for the first time. (It
                    was around that time that I also started web production, feeling my way around.)
                    <br>
                    Exhibiting my work itself was not difficult, as it only required an application, but I was rejected
                    at the first exhibition I applied to, in Tohoku.
                    <br>
                    Even at that time, I was not good at writing summaries and other writing, and I did not understand
                    why an explanation or meaning was necessary when I was asked to explain something, so I could only
                    write about one line.
                    <br>
                    I knew that if I continued like this, the deadline I set for myself would pass, so I changed my
                    perspective a little and looked for exhibitions around the country, and I came across an exhibition
                    hosted by a company called "Reijinsha."
                    <br>
                    That was my first step in exhibiting, and I decided to continue my work as an abstract painter.

                    On the other hand, web production was a constant struggle.
                    <br>
                    Although I had learned a little bit of coding at vocational school, I had completely forgotten it,
                    and since I didn't have a computer, I started working on a tablet.
                    <br>
                    I struggled with the unfamiliar WordPress screen, and little by little I learned by myself.
                    When I had become somewhat accustomed to using WordPress, I finally bought a computer.
                    <br>
                    I was really surprised at that time.
                    <br>
                    The screen was easy to see, the operation was smooth, and I remember being impressed just by that.
                    <br>
                    I continued to learn by myself, and around 2022 I found out about ChatGPT, and by learning while
                    asking questions, my understanding deepened even further.
                    <br>
                    And now, I am back in the place of expression, drawing works and continuing my exhibition
                    activities.
                    <br>
                    I would like to continue to believe in my own instincts and connect with the world, even if it is
                    just a little at a time.
